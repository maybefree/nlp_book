                <p><strong>Description:</strong> bosworths mussolini allows us to come closer than ever before to an understanding of the life and actions of the dictator and of the political world and society within which he operated this biography paints a picture of brutality and failure in governance with insight into mussolini as a human being shaped by the particular patterns of italian society which were so vastly different from axis partners germany and japanmussolini was a brutal tyrant who added untold numbers to the dead of war torn europe but we cannot understand his regime by equating it with hitler or stalin his life began modestly in the provinces and he maintained a traditional family life for a man of his time including both a wife and mistresses he sought in his way to be an intellectual but was capable of cruelty and was a racist with the consistency and vigor which would have made him a good recruit for the ss he sought an empire but for the most part was more of an oldfashioned nineteenth century despot not a racial or ideological imperiumhis end came in 1945 in the closing days of world war ii disguised in german greatcoat and helmet mussolini attempted to escape from the advancing allied armies but was stopped by partisans who recognized his features made so familiar by fascist propaganda which eventually gave him away and within 24 hours he was publicly executed</p>
