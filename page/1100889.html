                <p><strong>Description:</strong> the immediate impact of deindustrializationthe suffering inflicted upon workers their families and their communitieshas been widely reported by scholars and journalists in this important volume the authors seek to move discussion of americas industrial decline beyond the immediate ramifications of plant shutdowns by placing it into a broader social political and economic context emphasizing a historical approach the authors explore the multiple meanings of one of the major transformations of the twentieth centurythe concept of deindustrialization entered the popular and scholarly lexicon in 1982 with the publication of the deindustrialization of america by barry bluestone and bennett harrison beyond the ruins both builds upon and departs from the insights presented in that benchmark study in this volume the authors rethink the chronology memory geography culture and politics of industrial change in americataken together these original essays argue that deindustrialization is not a story of a single emblematic place such as flint or youngstown or a specific time period such as the 1980s nor is it limited to the abandoned factory buildings associated with heavy industry rather deindustrialization is a complex process that is uneven in its causes timing and consequences the essays in this volume examine this process through a wide range of topics from worker narratives and media imagery to suburban politics environmental activism and commemorationjohn sweeney president aflcio</p>
