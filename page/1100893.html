                <p><strong>Description:</strong> when this book and its companion volume image of the people appeared in 1973 they were taken as a challenge to the way art was usually written about this book said the times is a product of that school of art history whose history is as well read as its art and whilst it covers only a small area of time and place clarks approach and style are such that it throws up enough ideas and pleasures to illuminate far beyond its rather special circumstances it is suffused with wit and pathetic ironyt j clarks subject is painting and printmaking in the years following the 1848 revolution in france a time he argues when art and politics could not escape each other the book tells the story of a handful of artists trying to take advantage of that unfamiliarand shortlivedsituation daumier and millet are central particularly in their dealings with the new states art patronage machine delacroix figures as painter and diarist in agonized withdrawal from the possibility of change haunted by his own liberty guiding the people and baudelaire is depicted after a moment of tortured political involvement in the first months of the republic as the great poet of postrevolutionary despair</p>
